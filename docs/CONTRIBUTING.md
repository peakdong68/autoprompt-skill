# Contributing to Autoprompt

Keep changes focused and show that they work.

## Before you start

- Read the [README](../README.md) and [support guide](SUPPORT.md).
- Search existing issues before opening a bug report, feature request, or benchmark request.
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Report vulnerabilities through the [security policy](SECURITY.md), never publicly.

## Make the change

1. Start from current `main` on a short, descriptive branch.
2. Keep one logical change per pull request.
3. Update focused tests and documentation when behavior changes.
   Use Node.js 20+ and a Python 3.11+ environment exposed as `python`.
   Install the Python test dependencies in that environment:

   ```console
   python -m pip install PyYAML jsonschema
   ```

4. If `agents/contracts/` changes, regenerate provider views:

   ```console
   node scripts/generate-provider-contracts.cjs
   ```

5. After changing runtime files, refresh their file inventory:

   ```console
   node scripts/runtime-payload.cjs --generate
   ```

6. Run focused tests while editing, then verify the full change:

   ```console
   npm run verify
   ```

Some checks need PowerShell, Bash, or Python 3. List any relevant check you could not run.
