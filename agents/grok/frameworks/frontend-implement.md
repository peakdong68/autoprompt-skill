# Frontend capability change

Implement the assigned UI capability so a user can reach it and complete the requested interaction.

## Assignment and control

Use the selected route and its canonical compiled checks. DIRECT and LIGHT use no
coordinator, manager, or roadmap. ROADMAP execution follows the accepted plan and
recorded dependencies. Only the run owner selects independent checkers; workers do
not start other agents. Follow the ownership rules in `composition.md`.

## Work and evidence

Inspect the existing UI and establish the required behavior, entry point, data flow,
and relevant loading, empty, error, populated, overflow, and disabled states. Preserve
existing conventions and identify keyboard, accessible-label, focus, and responsive
requirements. Return material product or design conflicts to the run owner before
implementing dependent behavior.

Record the real build and test baseline. Add behavior tests before implementation when
feasible, then change only owned files. Respect platform contracts for state, effects,
keys, controlled inputs, and events. Connect the capability to its real entry point and
data instead of leaving a working isolated example.

The independent checker uses the rendered UI across the affected states and viewports,
including the relevant keyboard journey. A source review alone cannot prove usability;
record unavailable rendered evidence as an unmet check after permitted recovery.

## Independent checking

One independent checker reviews and tests the frozen result by default. An additional
checker requires a named distinct risk or responsibility and separate evidence. Check
the requested behavior, relevant failure cases, and the existing tests of touched
modules and direct dependents. Compare failures with the recorded baseline; an
unrelated pre-existing failure is not a new regression. Investigate every new failure
before acceptance. Meet the request's coverage requirements and the 95% changed-line
floor for executable code, recording the measurement and any applicable exclusions.

## Recovery and result

A failed command starts diagnosis. Check the command, working directory, supported
runtime, and available dependencies; repair authorized local setup or an owned defect
within the recorded allowance. A changed result or check invalidates its dependent
evidence. Repeat those checks before reporting success. Do not weaken tests, conceal
regressions, or replace a required real result with a simulated pass.

Return repairable failures to the responsible owner. A repeated failure with unchanged
evidence requires strategy reassessment, not equivalent new workers. Preserve valid
results and all run-wide limits. Report `BLOCKED` only when an external, authority,
environment, or policy condition still prevents required work after permitted diagnosis
and recovery; include the command, observed failure, and concrete unblock condition.
Report an unresolved scope or ownership conflict to the run owner without editing
unowned resources. Only new route facts justify changing the route.

Return the exact result version, requested items completed, commands and exit codes,
check evidence, remaining defects, and attempted recovery. The run owner requests
completion only after every requested result passes its current required checks and
all working agents have stopped. The deterministic control plane records `DONE`.
